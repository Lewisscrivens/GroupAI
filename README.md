# Group-AI

An Unreal Engine 4 project created for my Computer Game Studio 2 module at The University Of Huddersfield.

------------------------------------------------------------------

The project is created to show understanding of advanced game AI that contains the following features:

- Path-finding in dynamic game world.
- Group interaction with other AI for decision making.
- Strategic planning in real time.

------------------------------------------------------------------

The demo game I will be building on this project to show the features of the GroupAI. 

The demo will be a hide and seek type of game where the AI bot(s) will look for the player as they try to 
make their way from the start point to the end point. Alerting any AI will in turn alert the rest after a 
realistic wait time and if the AI loses the player the last known location is used to find which way the player
could have gone. The bots will also make efforts to block the player into an area.
