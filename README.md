# Group-AI

An Unreal Engine 4 project created for my Computer Game Studio 2 module at The University Of Huddersfield.

Packaged game can be found at the following link: https://github.com/lewisscrivens98/GroupAIGame

------------------------------------------------------------------

The project is created to show understanding of advanced game AI that previews path finding in a game world, group interaction to help corner the player and interaction with objects in the world.

I have also used RVO avoidance to help AI find there way around each other.

Features:

- The project included 3 demonstration levels, a game, a top down version of the game to preview the movement of the AI and finally a test map to more easily view the AI's behaviour.
- Objective system.
- Interactive events.
- Ability to hide from AI.
- AI alerts other AI of players location.
- AI searches for player when lost.
- AI returns to a patrol behavior to randomly search the game level.
- Custom waypoint system.
- User interface with mini-map.
- Audio for most events.
- Timer that indicates score once the game is over.

Objective in the game level:

- Find randomly generated keyboard to hack into.
- Find keycard to get into the security office.
- Deactivate security system in the security office.
- Exit the building.

NOTE: Once these objectives are all complete the game will end and it will give you a score based on the time taken to complete.
